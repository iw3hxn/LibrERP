    "name" : "MSN Live Chat",
    "version" : "1.0",
    "category" : "Tools",
    "description" : """This module provides a Windows Live Messenger button (top right menu) to chat with the email of your choice.
    For instance, all your OpenERP users could chat with support@my-company.com (support need to have a wlm account, but can use this email through their phone, laptop, pidgin, and so on..). The users can use their wlm account or log-on as "Visitor".  
    
    To set this addon up, you will have to :
    
    - Log on your Windows Live account (http://hotmail.com/)
    - Go to this URL : http://settings.messenger.live.com/applications/WebSettings.aspx
    
    - Tick the checkbox "Allow anyone on the web to see my presence and send me messages." then click on the button "Save".
    => It's mandatory to be able to chat with you and see whether you're off-line, away, busy or available.

    - Then click on "Create HTML" on the right side menu, scrolldown to the section with the HTML code and copy your key
    => the key is the part between "invitee=" and "@apps.messenger.live.com", eg: 5853ad247d1c7d0e

    - Finally replace the two "my_own_key" in the file ~/web_wlm_chat/static/src/xml/base.xml by your own key (eg: 5853ad247d1c7d0e).
    => Now you can install the module in OpenERP.
    

    /!\ Be careful, if you don't want to copy only your key but the full code, remove the "&" otherwise you won't be able to see any views...
